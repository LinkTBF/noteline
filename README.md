Do you forget the last code line you jumped which is important for you? We waste too many time to look for less line you refer frequently when coding because of the Pareto-Principle.

The noteline is a useful vscode extension help you:

- Record the line your cursor focus to `System Records` part, or add line to `Custom Notes` part by context menu.
- Auto order the line of `System Records` by trend which is compute by your scroll action and time.
- Write a note to a line.
- Open editor and jump to the line which has been recorded.
